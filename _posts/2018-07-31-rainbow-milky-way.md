A picture is worth a thousand words.
Let's see how to create it!

## Step 1: Camera settings
I've used a **Nikon D610** with a **Samyang 14mm** with the following settings: 
```
ISO 1600
50 sec (bulb)
f/2.8
```
My main problem was finding the point of infinity focus on my lens. You can do it by trial and error, or by lighting a torch to a friend far enough away, and focusing on it.

I've used an external super cheap shooting control and a stopwatch to use a `50 sec` time with the `bulb` shutter speed mode.

### Some questions
- **Why not an higher iso value?** 
   Read [This](https://photographylife.com/iso-invariance-explained).

- **Why not lower speed?** 
   To keep the stars as punctual as possible. A lower speed would have caused a startrail.

- **Is `f/2.8` too open? Don't you lose sharpness in this way?**
   Yes, it is, but I do not have an astroseeker, so to keep the milky-way so bright, I had no choice.


## Step 2: The shooting

Framing well in total darkness is a mess. You do not see anything in the viewfinder. This is the way I use: 
### A simple tip
> shot test images with iso settings at the max value, aperture wide opened, and low shutter speed (~1 sec).

In this way you can understand what is in front of you, and make some adjustment on the composition.
Once everything is ok, you can start the shooting.
Always remember to check that the focus is ok after the first image.

## Step 3: First preprocessing
Firstly I adjust each image with lightroom more or less in this way:

![]({{"/assets/gif/first_preprocessing.gif" | absolute_url}})

Keep in mind to sync the setting across all images, to keep color almost the same.

## Step 4: First photoshop attempt to create the panorama
Select all the images on Lightroom, then select the option to create a panorama in Photoshop.
After this, this is what i've done:

## Step 5: Final corrections in lightroom
Export the image from photoshop, and open it in Lightroom.
