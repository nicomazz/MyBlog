## The intentions
The aim was to shot images to the night sky. I'm from venice, and the following map show that I must move from here to shot without so much light pollution. So it was. 
The initial intentions were to spend 2 nights in tent on the dolimites, near Cortina.

## Long story short
The weather forecast was really bad. Virtually every day percentages close to 100% of rain. We therefore reserved different options.
- **Lagazuoi**: With its 2800m it was also the most dangerous destination in the event of storms. So we decided to go here for the first night ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- **5 Torri**: 2200m, near Lagazuoi, from "Rifugio Scoiattoli". We spent our second night here, under an incessant hail. We were not able to see the 5 towers before the next morning.
- **Sorapis Lake**: The camping or bivouac is strictly prohibited here, with many signs and indications of fines. We therefore decided to go there only on the afternoon of the second day.

## Detailed trip planned

### Day 1 - Lagazuoi
- Arrive at Lagazuoi cableway here: [46.519492, 12.008374](https://goo.gl/maps/k4Yn7Rve4bx). Follow direction for Passo di Falzarego.
- Now you have 2 choices. we have chosen the second one
    + **The easy way**: take the cableway (11€). Last trip at 16:40 (we arrived at 16:37).
    + **The not so easy way**: go by walk. Precisely 2h. Tested. 
- Eat at Lagazuoi refuge (~13€ each)
- Shot the sunset

- Go to the cross (46.529768, 12.003071) and mount the tents

In the last image is clearly visible a green spot. I think it could be aurora borealis. What's your opinion?

### Day 2 - Sorapis lake & Scoiattoli
- Wakeup at 10 AM

- Breakfast at Lagazuoi refuge
- Destination Sorapis Lake. you have to find parking [here](https://goo.gl/maps/BFWw3qWKWTC2) (Good luck!). We stopped at Cortina to buy something to eat (go [here](https://goo.gl/maps/557AReqY9L92))
- 2h to arrive at the lake, 1:50h to return back. As it was all wet, it was not so easy, but doable.

- We had dinner at 5 torri refugee. You can arrive there by car, but the street is not so easy. You must book to eat here. Meanwhile it started to rain very heavy.
- From 5 torri refugee to scoiattoli is about 20 minutes. Very near.
- As we arrived in front of Scoiattoli refugee we were in the middle of very thick fog. We were in front of the 5 towers, but we were not able to see them. We fastly mounted our tents, when it started to to hail. the hail will not stop all night. 0 photos here, since the gray sunrise.

### Day 3 - Passo Giau
- After the rainy night we headed towards the passo Giau. It's absolutely a must see.
