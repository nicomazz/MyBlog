Macro lenses cost a lot of money, and they give you only 1:1 magnification ratio.
If you want something more than this, you have to buy very specific lenses at at prohibitive prices (Like `Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x`).

 I do all my great magnification macros with less than 70 € (camera excluded). Here's how I do it!


## My setup


#### Standard hardware setup 
- `Nikon D3100` (recently D610)
- External flash `YongNuo YN560` (not really necessary if you shot outside under heavy light). Better if with a small diffuser.

#### Additions to do macro photography
- **Very old manual Canon 28mm f2.8** (paid 30€). 
You must check that there's a way to change the aperture completely manually. Usually there is a small lever in the lens attach. I use scotch to keep it in the right position.
- Inversion ring ( < 10 €)
- Extension tubes (~10 € without contacts)
- A friend. If you don't have one, a tripod.

#### Post production tools
- Lightroom
- Photoshop 

At first I was very skeptical about the final results, then after practice and lens fine tuning, I think I have found the correct formula.

So connect the camera with the tubes and the inverted lens, find a spider, use a flash, and the result should look like this:

Ok, it's not that simple actually. Keep reading!



## Problems that you will surely find (and their solutions)
### No visibility in the viewfinder
**In short**: Use a very powerful torch to light your subject (Zoommable `CREE` torch are cheap and perfect)

The combination of extension tubes, reverse lense, and small aperture will lead you to always see black in the viewfinder.
I usually use this torch completely zommed.

You can find it for less than 10 € from Aliexpress.
### Very short depth of field
**In short**: Shot a lot of images with the aperture very closed, then merge then by doing a **Focus stack**.

When you shot a photo things are sharp between two parallel planes. The distance between these determines the depth of field. With this kind of photography these planes are incredibly close each other, so it's difficult to have all our subject in focus. 

To handle this problem I use a technique called **Focus stack**. It consists in shooting a lot of images, continuously moving the camera back and forth. Then with an appropriate software I keep all the focused part of each image, to recreate the entire subject focused.

Another (not really) "fix" for this problem is to close the lens aperture. I usually shot between f9 and f11. But you can also close at maximum, the DoF will remain very short (some fraction of a millimeter)

> **Tip**: The image above is slightly different from every other. I was alone, in a very uncomfortable position. So I've set flash to the maximum power, aperture near the minimum, and after some simple post processing this is the final image, **from a single frame**!


### Difficulties to keep the subject in focus 
Support yourself with the hand under the lens resting on the wall, table or anything stable and perform very small oscillations.

I took this photo resting on a branch of a tree, after an hour of attempts. It's the result of a focus stacking of 5 images (if I remember well).


### Every image is too dark
The only solution to this is a **flash**. 

If you have to buy a new one, check that it 
support **slave mode**, so it can fire when it sees the main camera flash (it works with a light sensor). If you have an old one without this capability, some cheap **triggers** cost ~10 €. I've bought the `YongNuo YN560` for ~50 €, and it's perfect.

**Don't use it mounted on the camera**. Put it directly above the subject. To do this, ask help to a friend, or use a tripod. 

### Finding someone who keeps flash
I can't give you advice here (:

If the subject is still, use a tripod. Otherwise, if you're alone, good luck.
