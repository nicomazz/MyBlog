Macro lenses cost a lot of money, and they give you only 1:1 magnification ratio.
If you want something more than this, you have to buy very specific lenses at at prohibitive prices (Like `Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x`).

I do all my great magnification macros with less than 70 € (camera excluded). Here's how I do it!

{% include gallery caption="Some of my macro images" %}

## My setup


### Standard hardware setup
- `Nikon D3100` (recently `D610`). Any camera is ok. In this case `APS-C` is better than `FULL-FRAME`, thanks to the 1.5x magnification ratio (read [this](http://www.mdavid.com.au/photography/apscversusfullframe.shtml))
- External flash `YongNuo YN560` (not really necessary if you shot outside under heavy light with a tripod). Better if with a small diffuser.

### Additions to do macro photography
- **Very old manual Canon 28mm f2.8** (paid 30€).
You must check that there's a way to change the aperture completely manually. Usually there is a small lever in the lens attach. I use scotch tape to keep it in the right position.
- Inversion ring ( < 10 €)
- Extension tubes (~10 € without contacts)
- A friend. If you don't have one, a tripod.

### Post production tools
- Lightroom
- Photoshop

At first I was very skeptical about the final results, then after practice and lens fine tuning, I think I have found the correct formula.

So connect the camera with the tubes and the inverted lens, find a spider, use a flash, and the result should look like this:

</figure>
Ok, it's not that simple actually. Keep reading!


### Camera setup
Start only with the lens reversed, without extension tubes, to practice a bit.
Put the camera in `M` mode. You must set the aperture of the lens manually.

I usually set the aperture from `f8` to `f13`. If you keep the aperture too open, you will not have enough depth of field ([As I will write](#very-short-depth-of-field)), but you will have more light. If you'll close too much, the image will be too dark and sensor dust will be more visible.

For the shutter speed, the setup is complicated. If you use a flash, always put `1/200`. Otherwise, try to do some tests.


### Flash setup
If you don't have a tripod, or you can't use one, you **must** use an external flash.

Put it in [slave mode](#every-image-is-too-dark), and set the camera to shot with the flash at the minimum power. If your external flash doesn't have "slave mode", buy some triggers.

A diffuser helps.

Keep the flash as near as possible to the subject.

> If your subject is not still or  you don't have a tripod, you **MUST** use an external flash. If your lens is short, the camera one should be ok.

## Where do I find subjects?
Mainly in my house. Small insect are everywhere. Check on plants, or in a wood.
## How do you take pictures of them if they're never standing still?
It takes really a lot of time. To spray cold water helps, but not so much. I don't shot to dead insect. Try to go outside at the sunrise (I've never done it).


## Focus stack technique
As I will write [here](#very-short-depth-of-field), one of the main problem, it the short depth of field.
So I shot a brust of photos of the subject by keeping in focus different parts, and then I stitch them in the following way
### My Focus stack workflow
- Import images in lightroom
- Fix Image defect like [sensor dust](#sensor-dust)
- Increase of the sharpness and luminance
- Export all the images
- Open them as layers in Photoshop
- Align them
- Photo merge
- Manual fixes (this could be a very long process)

## Problems that you will surely find (and their solutions)

### No visibility in the viewfinder

**In short**: Use a very powerful torch to light your subject (Zoommable `CREE` torch are cheap and perfect)
The combination of extension tubes, reverse lense, and small aperture will lead you to always see black in the viewfinder.
I usually use this torch completely zommed.

You can find it for less than 10 € from Aliexpress.



### Very short depth of field
**In short**: Shot a lot of images with the aperture very closed, then merge then by doing a **Focus stack**.
<figure>
<a href="https://img2.juzaphoto.com/001/shared_files/uploads_hr/896202_large79257.jpg"><img src="https://img2.juzaphoto.com/001/shared_files/uploads_hr/896202_large79257.jpg"></a>

</figure>
When you shot a photo things are sharp between two parallel planes. The distance between these determines the depth of field. With this kind of photography these planes are incredibly close each other, so it's difficult to have all our subject in focus.


To handle this problem I use a technique called **Focus stack**. It consists in shooting a lot of images, continuously moving the camera back and forth. Then with an appropriate software I keep all the focused part of each image, to recreate the entire subject focused.

Another (not really) "fix" for this problem is to close the lens aperture. But you can also close at maximum, the DoF will remain very short (some fraction of a millimeter)

</figure>

> **Tip**: The image above is slightly different from every other. I was alone, in a very uncomfortable position. So I've set flash to the maximum power, aperture near the minimum, and after some simple post processing this is the final image, **from a single frame**!

### Camera Buffer and flash charge rate

A really big problem with low-end cameras is the [buffer](https://www.lifewire.com/camera-image-buffer-492951) size. This can limitate the number of continuous brust shots that you can take. With the `D3100`, after a brust of ~10 images, I had to wait ~20 seconds so that the camera elaborate the photos.

Similar problem for the internal flash charge speed. After some flashes, it must be recharged. To overcome this problem you can use external triggers. (I've never used them)

### Difficulties to keep the subject in focus
Support yourself with the hand under the lens resting on the wall, table or anything stable and perform very small oscillations.

<figcaption>A difficult image. I took this photo resting on a branch of a tree, after an hour of attempts. It's the result of a focus stacking of 5 images (if I remember well).</figcaption>
</figure>



### Every image is too dark
The only solution to this is a **flash**.

If you have to buy a new one, check that it
support **slave mode**, so it can fire when it sees the main camera flash (it works with a light sensor). If you have an old one without this capability, some cheap **triggers** cost ~10 €. I've bought the `YongNuo YN560` for ~50 €, and it's perfect.

> **Don't use the flash mounted on the camera**. Put it directly above the subject. To do this, ask help to a friend, or use a tripod. I've build a support.

### Finding someone who keeps flash
I can't give you advice here (:

If the subject is still, use a tripod. Otherwise, if you're alone, good luck.

> **Tip**: If you use a flash, use a diffuser to!

### Sensor dust
You can't get away from sensor dust. All my images initially have a lot of black spots. I remove that in the following way
